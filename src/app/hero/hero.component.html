      <h1>About Bee</h1>
      <p>
        Finding housing has become a nightmare riddled with scams, fees, and hidden costs. 
        With the Bee Token, we are creating a safe housing exchange platform powered by 
        Ethereum and our own side chain to make affordable, decentralized short-term housing a reality.
        <br>
        <br>
        Created by engineers from Google and Uber, Bee and by extension the Bee Token 
        strive to put the power back into the hands of the consumers by cutting out the 
        middle man and pushing the savings and benefits back to the homeowners and renters.
